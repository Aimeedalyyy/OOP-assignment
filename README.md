# OOP-assignment
the idea for this assignment is to have a piece of music made by jack with 3-5 different instruments (audio files) that when played together will create one trad piece.

to add another audio file:
-add another audioplayer and audiobuffer variable (ap + ab) in lines 13 and 15 of the public class.
-In setup assign the ap variable to the new file being added.
