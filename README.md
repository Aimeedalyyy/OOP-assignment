# OOP-assignment
the idea for this assignment is to have a piece of music made by jack with 3-5 different instruments (audio files) that when played together will create one trad piece.

to add another audio file:
-add another audioplayer and audiobuffer variable (ap + ab) in lines 13 and 15 of the public class.
-In setup assign the ap variable to the new file being added.

Rubric
-The assignment is technically complex with lots of elements responding to or synchronised to sound.
-Lots of interactivity
-You have done lots of self directed learning and included advanced coding techniques that you have taught yourself.
-The visual is synchronised to the music perfectly.
-You will have used PVectors, transforms and classes to create autonomous elements in the assignment. 
-Your code is organised into classes that use inheritance and polymorphism.
-The assignment is well documented
-You made or programmed all the art assets to a high standard.
-You worked on the assignment making steady progress and have documented this.
